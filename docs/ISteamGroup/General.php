            <h2>A New Interface</h2>
            <p>To facilitate Group functionality for WebAPI, a new interface is best to implement a suite of methods for groups. While information may work in concert with other interfaces, Groups themselves are robust enough to warrant a new interface.</p>
            
            <h2>New Methods</h2>
            <p>The new methods for this group separate data based on frequency of need. Metadata for example doesnâ€™t need to be polled as frequently as the online status of group members.</p>
            
            <h2>Common Inputs</h2>
            <p>Unless otherwise noted, All Methods will take the following input parameters, even if the method may not need them.</p>
